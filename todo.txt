Problems I have had
	1) Fan using the serial pins
	2) Sending emoji over text
	3) Syncing time to master clock
	4) Max length of 70 in UCS2 encoding
	5) GSM Module stopped working randomly
	6) Factory reset issues
    7) Flask app runs 2 times making 2 instance of monitor thread something related to debug being on or reloader when code is saved
    8) Shutting application down nicely
